          <p>On 2 March, 2013, around 60 women organised themselves in Konar, a village in Bihar’s Rohtas district. They were agitated by the rampant alcoholism among the men, which subjected women to regular harassment on streets and domestic violence at home.</p>
          <p>“The sale of liquor will not continue at the cost of our honour,” cried Konar’s women as they marched towards the village’s wine shop.</p>

        <div>
        <p>Looking up to the protest in Konar, women across the state of Bihar staged demonstrations. They raided illegal breweries, smashed bottles, and locked wineshops, demanding a ban on alcohol.</p>
        <p>Domestic violence, which was largely viewed as a private matter, came into the public sphere in one of India’s most gender unequal states. </p>

        <p>Women's movement had made its mark. Incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar saw an opportunity to monetise the constituency of women voters and promised a statewide prohibition in his campaigning during the 2015 state Assembly elections.</p>
        <p>In the polls that saw record turnout of women, Nitish returned as chief minister for a third consecutive term.</p>
        <p>A few months after the victory, in April 2016, Nitish government enacted Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016, prohibiting the manufacture, trade, storage, transportation, sale, and consumption of liquor in the state.</p>

    <div class="byline">
      <p>By Naman Shah</p>
    </div>
    <p>If we look at the trend of domestic violence in Bihar, one of the primary drivers for the prohibition law, the rate of registered cases under Section 498 A of Indian Penal Code (which looks at Cruelty by Husband or his relatives) has fallen to more than half since 2016.</p>
    <iframe title="Cases registered under IPC Section 498 A (Cruelty by Husband or his relatives) in Bihar" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-mkBLo" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mkBLo/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="454" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}})}();
    </script>
    <p>Anecdotally, too, <a href="https://caravanmagazine.in/gender/bihar-women-prohibition-benefits-wane-alcoholism-persists">women have credited</a> the ban on alcohol for reduced brawls with their husbands. They claim that the household earnings that were earlier spent on the drinking habits of men, are now spent on other necessary utilities, including children’s education.</p>
    <iframe title="2015 vs 2022: District-wise change in cases pertaining to IPC Section 498 A (Cruelty by Husband or his relatives)" aria-label="map" id="datawrapper-chart-N1akC" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/N1akC/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="597" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}})}();

    <p>But <a href="https://www.policycircle.org/opinion/prohibition-policy-bihar-india/">reports also warn</a> about establishing such an oversimplistic connection between domestic violence and prohibition. Domestic violence is a complex issue rooted in patriarchy and other behavioural patterns. A number of other women-centric policies may also have helped in women empowerment and reduced their harassment. While prohibition certainly may have contributed significantly to the less hostile domestic lives for women, <a href="https://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/governance/impact-of-bihar-s-alcohol-ban-on-intimate-partner-violence.html">studies</a> indicate that it may not be the sole factor.</p>

    <p>However, before the prohibition, women <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-11/india-deadly-prohibition-state-bihar/105010860">recall</a>, “it was impossible to walk on the streets without facing harassment and abuse. Men drank everywhere.” According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2015-16, <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/fr339/fr339.pdf#page=403">28.9 per cent of men</a> aged between 15-49 in Bihar were alcohol consumers. The widespread alcoholism can be attributed to the excise policy of Nitish Kumar’s first term as Bihar’s chief minister between 2005-10. The state’s treasury was struggling as it had limited sources of revenue. His government decided to liberalise the trade of liquor to push its sale for higher excise revenues. As a result, the number of wineshop licenses in the state <a href="https://jgu.edu.in/jsgp/jindal-policy-research-lab/sipping-on-change-bihars-journey-into-alcohol-prohibition/">increased</a> from 3,436 in 2006-07 to 5,467 in 2012-13. Villages, particularly, reported an increase of over 200 percent. Bihar’s excise revenue jumped from Rs 500 crore in 2006 to Rs 3,217 crore in 2015.</p>
    <p>So, when alcohol was suddenly prohibited in the state where drinking was quite prevalent, people naturally gravitated towards other means to acquire their booze. Bihar not only had a high demand for alcohol, but also a high rate of unemployment. These were ideal conditions for the development of an illicit liquor economy.</p>

    <h2>The downside of Bihar’s prohibition</h2>

    <p>Bihar shares its international border with Nepal, and domestic borders with the states of Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and West Bengal. None of these places have a ban on liquor and they became a source for smuggling alcohol into dry Bihar.</p>
    <iframe title="Excise revenue of adjoining states jumped after Bihar's prohibition" aria-label="Multiple Lines" id="datawrapper-chart-pi2tr" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pi2tr/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="756" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}})}();
    </script>
    <p>Apart from smuggling, Bihar saw a massive bootleg manufacturing in the countryside. A statement issued by the Department of Prohibition, Excise and Registration said, "Officials concerned have so far seized 30.86 million bulk litres of liquor which includes country-made liquor as well. Till March 31, 2025, a total of over 900,000 cases pertaining to violation of prohibition laws have been registered by the department in which a total of over 1.4 million people have been arrested so far."</p>

    <p>Punishment under the prohibition law was <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/bihar-prohibition-an-unmitigated-disaster">deemed harsh.</a> Some of the law’s worst features were holding the entire family liable to imprisonment if any family member violated the liquor ban.</p>

    <p>Reports also revealed that the prohibition law disproportionately targeted people from the marginalised communities. An <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bihars-prohibition-crackdown-two-years-later-obc-ebc-sc-st-face-brunt-nitish-kumar-liquor-ban-5193755/">Indian Express investigation</a> in May 2018 found that more than two-third of a total of 1,22,392 people arrested under the prohibition law came from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.</p>

    <p>Following criticism, Nitish government made amendments that loosened some of the act’s draconian provisions in July 2018.</p>

    <p>Accessing alcohol isn’t as easy as earlier, but those who want to drink can still get it, although at a higher price – both, in terms of money, as well as in terms of life. Hooch tragedies became a regular occurrence in Bihar. As per the official records, the State has witnessed around 190 'confirmed hooch deaths' since 2016.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>The judiciary has made <a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/politics/bihar-liquor-ban-impact-corruption-politics-2016-2024-analysis/article68889699.ece">strong remarks</a> on the poor execution of prohibition by the state government. The Patna High Court has noted that the police as well as officials of the excise, tax, and transport departments were colluding with bootleggers and pointed out that the poor were becoming both victims of hooch tragedies and offenders under the law for consumption of liquor. In 2021, the then Chief Justice of India (CJI), N.V. Ramana, dubbed the Bihar liquor law an example of “lack of oversight”. “There are 300,000 cases pending in the courts. People are waiting for justice for a long time, and now the excessive cases related to liquor violations put additional burden on courts.”</p>

    <p>The limited resources of the state police and administration has been overwhelmed to monitor the widespread flouting of prohibition. Despite regular operations, alcohol is still readily available through hidden channels.</p>

    <p>These shortcomings have made prohibition a big political issue. The critics say that instead of continuing an ineffective prohibition, alcohol should be legalised and tax collection from its sale should be invested in the welfare of Bihar, which fares poorly among all major human development indices.</p>

    <p>But do the social benefits of prohibition for women pale in front of the economic loss?</p>
