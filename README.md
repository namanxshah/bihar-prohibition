# How effective has prohibition been in Bihar?

## Project 2 - Lede 2025

### Objective
After being dissatisfied with my [first project](https://namanxshah.github.io/zoos/), I wanted to be more ambitious with my second one. My first project didn't feel like an accomplishment because I couldn't amply apply my Lede skills into it. Therefore, for my second project, I wanted to work on an idea that gives me the opportunity to utilise some of the new data collection/analysis, mapping skills acquired in Lede. When even after a lot of exploration I couldn't think of a suitable idea (which lets me work on APIs, BeautifulSoup, QGIS), I decided to compensate for it by adding a scrollytelling into it.

The idea for my second project was influenced by the growing chatter around the upcoming Bihar state Assembly elections. Bihar is among the most politically-charged states in India and its society is ridden with complex issues. One of the most debatable subjects is the state's prohibition law. While some say that it has made a positive social change in the state, others argue that it is a complete failure. I look at what the data says.

### Findings
The data I found indicates that Bihar's prohibition law was successful in reducing the cases of domestic violence but it also sprung up a flurry of other problems.

### How I approached the story
After doing some research, it was clear that the verdict on Bihar's prohibition law is not clearly black and white. There are fair arguments for and against it. I looked at various datasets and structured the story in a way that narrates both the sides.

### Data collection and Data visualization
I manually logged in a spreadsheet from different official sources:
1. For data on registered domestic violence cases, I looked at National Crime Record Bureau's [Crimes in India](https://www.ncrb.gov.in/crime-in-india-all-previous-publications.html) statistics for each year.
2. For data on excise revenue collection, I looked at each state's audit reports to [Comptroller and Auditor General of India](https://cag.gov.in/en/audit-report/) for all the years mentioned.
3. Since the data for specific arrests made under the prohibition law was not available, I looked at number of inmates in Biharâ€™s prisons to get a broad idea. The data for it came from National Crime Record Bureau's [Prisons in India](https://www.ncrb.gov.in/psi-all-previous-publications.html) yearly records.

The collected data was then visualized with datawrapper. I found line charts to be the most appropriate graph for all the datasets, so that's what I ended up using.

### New skills applied
This was the first time that I used image-based scrollytelling (although with the help of a [template](https://jsoma.github.io/page-templates/basic/index.html)). I used Adobe Illustrator for the first time on my own. It was tricky (mostly because I am a canva person), but thanks to YouTube tutorials, I managed somehow.

### Shortcomings
Once again, instead of scrapping data from web like an ideal Lede student, I collected data manually.
